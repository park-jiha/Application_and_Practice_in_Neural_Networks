# Project Ⅰ

## 1. Project Title
### Audio-based Emotion Recognition
To develop an audio-based emotion recognition framework that can convey realistic expressions

## 2. Project Introduction
### ■ Objective
The main goal of this project is to recognize emotions for conveying realistic expressions using audio. <br/>
The process involves preprocessing audio data to make it suitable for neural network training, and then using this training to classify emotions. <br/>
It can convey the user's intention and evolve into future work such as digital avatar animation capable of giving various facial expressions.

### ■ Motivation
Beyond simple communication like text or speech, next-generation communication systems capable of conveying rich prosody, expressiveness and identity are gaining attention. <br/>
Through this, users in next-generation digital environments like VR will be able to share and empathize with various emotions. <br/>
This project can also be utilized for medical purposes. <br/>
It is possible to develop an application that enables the free expression of thoughts for patients who find it challenging to convey their emotions. <br/>
Based on this project, it can be utilized in conjunction with research areas such as Computer Vision (CV) focused on generating images or videos of a user's face based on their emotional state, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that directly decodes user intentions from brain signals. <br/>
