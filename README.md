## 1. Project Title
### Audio-based Emotion Recognition
To develop an audio-based emotion recognition framework that can convey realistic expressions

## 2. Project Introduction
### ■ Objective
The main goal of this project is to recognize emotions for conveying realistic expressions using audio. <br/>
The process involves preprocessing audio data to make it suitable for neural network training, and then using this training to classify emotions. <br/>
It can convey the user's intention and evolve into future work such as digital avatar animation capable of giving various facial expressions.

### ■ Motivation
Beyond simple communication like text or speech, next-generation communication systems capable of conveying rich prosody, expressiveness and identity are gaining attention. <br/>
Through this, users in next-generation digital environments like VR will be able to share and empathize with various emotions. <br/>
Emotions can also be analyzed for medical purposes from a person's voice. <br/>
It has the potential to evolve into a system that can convey the feelings of patients who find it difficult to express their emotions. <br/>
